# g(r)
Radial Distribution Function

After complied by "icc -o gr gr.c", 
it uses input .xyz configuration file "configuration.xyz", 
to calculate g(r) and output results in "gr.dat". 
Periodic boundary condition is used here for the simulation box.

The program asks for on screen the following input parameters:

number of configurations

number of equilibration

particle number N

simulation box size L

number of bins of the histogram
